# ShadowAscend

**ShadowAscend** is a Minecraft plugin inspired by the universe of *Solo Leveling*. It introduces a dynamic RPG system where players become Hunters, enter dungeons, defeat monsters, and extract shadows to build their own armies ‚Äî all within a fully customized progression system.

## üìñ Lore-Driven Concept

After the appearance of mysterious gates connecting Earth to other dimensions, select individuals awakened as Hunters ‚Äî humans capable of fighting the monsters within. Unlike others, one man, Sung Jinwoo, gained the power to level up and extract shadows, rising to become something greater.

ShadowAscend brings that fantasy to life in Minecraft.
